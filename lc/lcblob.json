            "data": "<p>Step 1: Notice</p><p>The first stage in the eviction process is that the landlord must serve a valid notice on you. Different kinds of tenancies require different kinds of notice and different notice periods. This can be complex. The purpose of most notices is twofold: to allow you to remedy any breach and as the start of the eviction process if you do not. Therefore this is an opportunity to pay any rent arrears, modify any behaviour and come to an agreement with your landlord. They key thing is - do not ignore the notice, but contact your landlord and see what is required to get the notice withdrawn.</p><p>You should also get advice from Advice Lewisham on 0800 231 5453, Shelter advice line on 0808 800 4444 or a solicitor.</p><p>Step 2: A claim is issued in the county court</p><p>In most cases, a landlord must obtain a court possession order. The main exceptions are where you have a resident landlord or where you were put in interim accommodation pending a decision on your homelessness application, but there are other exceptions. If a possession order is not required then the landlord could change the locks when you are out, but they cannot use force to evict you or interfere with your belongings.</p><p>In most cases there must be a court hearing. The exception is eviction using Section 21 and the accelerated possession procedure. You can file a defence to the claim for possession using the form that is delivered with the possession claim. If there is a hearing, then you should also attend the hearing as this is your chance to explain your circumstances to the judge.</p><p>The judge will make a decision either at the court hearing, or if it is an accelerated possession claim, by looking at the papers. The judge will make a possession order if he or she is satisfied with the circumstances of the claim. The usual time between the judge&rsquo;s decision and the possession date is 14 days, but this can be extended to 42 days. However, in many cases the judge has a discretion about whether to make a possession order at all. If they do decide to make a possession order, they can suspend it, provided you comply with terms that they lay down. Therefore it is always important to send off the defence and attend any hearing.</p><p>Step 3: Eviction by court bailiffs</p><p>Even where a possession order is granted, it can only be enforced by court bailiffs or sometimes by High Court Sheriffs. If the bailiffs are attending you will receive a notice of eviction telling you the date and time. If the matter is transferred to the High Court then you should be notified of this.</p><p>You may be able to suspend the eviction. This will depend on whether the possession order is made on mandatory or discretionary grounds. It will tell you this on the possession order. The court cannot suspend the eviction if the possession order was made on mandatory grounds.</p>",

Once you have registered, you can get details of properties, make contact with other tenants and arrange to view their homes. When you find a suitable property and you and the other tenant are happy to swap, you can ask your landlord for permission to exchange. Your landlord has six weeks to decide whether or not to give you permission to exchange your tenancy.</p><p>It is illegal for you or the other tenant to charge a fee as part of the tenancy exchange. You could be evicted if you charge or receive any money to swap your home. Before you agree to a tenancy exchange, check what your tenancy rights will be in a new home. You may have different or fewer rights with your new tenancy. We can give you further advice if you are not sure what your rights will be. Some tenancy exchanges must be transferred using a deed of assignment. This is a legal document that must be signed by an independent witness.
